Some PHP Shell and backdoors i found recently

One of my sites attacked by a set of viruses named "Japanese Virus" Recently. a jobless guy used a hole in my site and uploaded several shells and backdoors in directories. after many attempts to detect and delete them, i download entire site and use VS Code search for 'eval', 'base64' and some other common used statements in php viruses.

this repository contains some of japanese virus's files, for those who want to research on it. note that i am not ever consent that any body use this repository for attack another sites.
